        <h4>1 - Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods</h4>
        <div>
          <p>In real life, a car is an object</p>
          <p>A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:</p>
          <p>All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.</p>
          <p>All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.</p>
          <p>It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.</p>
          <p><span class="mark">!</span> JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties.</p>
          <div class="code">
            <p>You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:</p>
            <p>DEMO-1:</p>
            <p id="demo"></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <!--  -->

        <h4>2 - Object Methods - THIS -</h4>
        <div>
          <p>Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.</p>
          <p>A method is a function stored as a property..</p>
          <div class="code">
            <p>You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:</p>
            <p>DEMO-2:</p>
            <p id="demo-2"></p>
            <p>DEMO-3:</p>
            <p id="demo-3"></p>
          </div>

          <p>In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.</p>

          <p>Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or pcalled).</p>

          <p>The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>In an object method, this refers to the object.</li>
            <li>Alone, this refers to the global object.</li>
            <li>In a function, this refers to the global object.</li>
            <li>In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.</li>
            <li>In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.</li>
            <li>Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><span class="mark">!</span> This is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this</p>
          <p>In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.</p>
          <p>In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.</p>
          <p>In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.</p>
          <p><span class="mark">!</span> Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!</p>
          <p class="code">
            x = new String(); <br />
            // Declares x as a String object
          </p>
          <p>Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.</p>
